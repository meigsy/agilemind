Description:

As a founder I want to develop an agentic AI application that uses agile principles to develop software so I can accelerate the productivity of developers.

Notes:
- The agile methodology is a great example of how an entity can recursively decompose problems and iteratively execute and adjust plans in order to accomplish high level goals
- Organization goals are composed of objectives are composed of epics are composed of stories are accomplished by a plan
- We can use this pattern to accomplish complex goals using LLMs
- Agents follow a "plan, execute, evaluate" loop to accomplish story goals
- During planning and evaluation an agent should take into account it's hierarchical context in order to ensure it's plans/actions align with goals of its parent and its parent's parent and so on.
